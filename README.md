As the name suggests, the name is to be determined (but I like the pun for now)

## Server
We should try and use a free server first. I have a linux server, but it's kinda hacky. It's running on an external HD because I suck at setting up things in BIOS.

## Data set

I'd like to use the NEON eddy covariance data. It's big, it's bad, and it'll be a challenge

## API

We'll need an API (basically a function) to grab data from NEON's portal to ingest it. A lot of the data is useless so it's kind of a pain to get interesting data. You have to download like 20GB to just pull 10kb of data you're interested in.  
Looks like they have an [API](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/) 

## Web stuff

something something, [`React`](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/)
